# Ballin Assignment B3

This repository holds the files for Mya Ballin's project work for Assignment B3 - OPTION B for STAT545B: Exploratory Data Analysis at UBC. Option B asked students to create their own shiny app with three features and deploy it.

## Running Instance

If you would like to view and test out the application created for this project, it is available at the following link: https://mxballin.shinyapps.io/steamexplorer/

## Description of the Application

This application seeks to allow the user to explore the the 'Steam Games' dataset that is available through the 'datateachr' package and can also be viewed on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset. It provides an opportunity for the user to select a genre or multiple genres of games they would be interested in playing and to refine their search by setting a price range and their language of choice.

The application offers two different displays, one that focuses on general information about the games that are within the user's criteria and the reviews that they have received on Steam and another that allows the user to view the recommended system requirements for games that have provided such information and meet the criteria.

#### Application Features

1. A sidebar panel with multiple select, slider, and single select filters that allow for user filtering of the data. This enables users to select and view only the data that they are interested in.
2. Two main panel tabs offering general information about the game and its review impressions and recommended hardware/software requirements on separate views. Creating the two tabs enables the user to more easily navigate all of the data they are being presented in the tables.
3. Interactable data tables that allow the user to further sort the information they are being provided. This allows the user to prioritize certain aspects of the information in the tables (for example price high to low or low to high).

## Documents

This repository contains the following folder:

steamexplorer - which contains the code for the Shiny application and deployment folder generated by the package rsconnect that is related to its hosting on shinyapps.io

## Running the code

The app.R document within the steamexplorer folder can be pulled to your local machine, modified, and run in Rstudio to create your own instance of the application. To deploy your own instance of the app, check out the information provided on the shinyapps.io 'Getting Started' page: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html
