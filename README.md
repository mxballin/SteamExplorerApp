# Ballin Assignment B3

This repository holds the files for Mya Ballin's project work for the Assignment B3 - OPTION B project for STAT545B: Exploratory Data Analysis at UBC. Option B asked students to create their own shiny app with three features and deploy it.

## Running Instance

If you would like to view and test out the application created for this project, it is available at the following link: <a href=" https://mxballin.shinyapps.io/steamexplorer/"> https://mxballin.shinyapps.io/steamexplorer/</a>

## Description of the Application

This application seeks to allow the user to explore the the 'Steam Games' dataset that is available through the 'datateachr' package and can also be viewed on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/steam-games-complete-dataset. It provides an opportunity for the user to select a genre or multiple genres of games they would be interested in playing and to refine their search by setting a price range and their language of choice.

The application offers two different displays, one that focuses on general information about the games that are within the user's criteria and the reviews that they have received on Steam and another that allows the user to view the recommended system requirements for games that have provided such information and meet the criteria.

## Documents

This repository contains the following folder:

steamexplorer - which contains the code for the Shiny application and deployment file related to its hosting on shinyapps.io

## Running the code

The app.R document within the steamexplorer folder can be pulled to your local machine, modified, and run in Rstudio to create your own instance of the application. To deploy your own instance of the app, check out the information provided on the shinyapps.io 'Getting Started' page: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html
